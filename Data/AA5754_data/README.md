Parametric processing study on 5754 Aluminum.

## Processing conditions

1. Polished
2. BB
3. Uniaxial
4. Plane Strain

## Regions of Interest

For each processing condition at each process step five regions of the surface are sampled.  The regions are autoaveraged and analyzed to generate mean centered data.  Currently, we are working with the as recieved autoaveraged datasets.  The description of the auto average adjust is contained within each folder's ``*.out`` file.
