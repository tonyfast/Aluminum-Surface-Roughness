Aluminum Surface Roughness explores Materials Informatics on the surface of Aluminum under several processing conditions.

## Datasets

Two datasets were provided by Mark Stoudt at the Materials Measurements Laboratory at the National Institute for Standards and Technology.

1. High Purity Aluminum - Is a study of the Aluminum Surface Roughness of the time of a single experiment.
2. 5574 Aluminum - deformed using multiple processing routes with RVE's extracted at different positions in the sample.
